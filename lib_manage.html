        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Library Management System</strong> is a platform designed to help manage and track the inventory of
            books and other materials within a library. The system will enable librarians and users (students, faculty,
            etc.) to efficiently manage book checkouts, returns, book reservations, and inventory. It streamlines the
            process of managing library resources, improving access to books and ensuring smooth operation of the
            library.</p>
