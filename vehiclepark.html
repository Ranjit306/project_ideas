        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Vehicle Parking Management System</strong> is a platform designed to help manage parking spaces in
            various locations, such as public parking lots, malls, and office complexes. The system allows users to
            reserve parking spots in advance, track available spaces in real time, and provide parking authorities with
            tools to manage and monitor parking capacity. It optimizes space utilization and enhances the overall
            parking experience for both vehicle owners and parking facility managers.</p>
